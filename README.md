# Backend Exam 2023 API Documentation

Welcome to our REST API documentation for our order system for managing orders. 
Our API allows users to create machines and customers, which can then be added to orders.

The order system is populated with a lot of data when running main, which can be queried 
with a tool like postman. If so, see endpoint documentation below. 

### Creating a machine 
A machine is composed of subassemblies, and each subassembly consists of various parts. An
already designed machine can be included in multiple orders through order lines.

However, for a new machine, the process involves creating parts, subassemblies, 
and finally, the machine â€“ in that specific order. Each machine is aware of its subassemblies, 
and subassemblies are linked to their respective parts.

Worth noting, if a Machine is deleted, its underlying subassemblies and parts are deleted in that 
order.

Our Order system is designed to receive a list of ids when relying on **Request objects**. 

### MachineRequest Object

{
"machineName": "your_machine_name",
"price": 1000,
"subassemblyIds": [1, 2, 3]
}

### SubassemblyRequest Object

{
"subassemblyName": "your_subassembly_name",
"partIds": [1, 2, 3]
}

### Creating an order 
An order consists of order lines, each containing a single machine. 
An order has one customer, and it may have multiple order lines. 
A customer must have an address associated with them to be linked to an order. 
If an order is deleted, 
its underlying order lines will also be deleted. Customers, on the other hand, persist in the system even if 
they have no associated orders. A customer can have multiple orders, but an order line can 
only be part of one order. 

An Order is created by sending an OrderRequest Object.

#### OrderRequest Object
{
"customerId": 1,
"orderLineIds": [1,2,3,4]
}

##### Order Object
{
"orderId": 1,
"orderDate": "2023-12-13T12:34:56",
"totalPrice": 14999,
"customer": {
  Customer object properties go here
},
"orderLines": [{OrderLine Object, OrderLine Object}]
}

### Customer
Customers can be created without specifying an address, only email and name is required.
However, as previously mentioned, they must have a registered address before being associated with any orders.
It's worth noting that a customer can have multiple addresses associated with their profile.
The creation of a customer involves sending a Customer Object through the designated API endpoint.

#### Customer Object

{
"customerId": 0,
"customerName": "John Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"orders": [],
"addresses": []
}

## Service Layer

Service layer is to a great extent making use records when sending result to controller. 

OrderResult is used when sending info when something is created or updated: 

{
"success": true,
"errorMessage": null,
"createdObject": { }
}

{
"success": true,
"errorMessage": "A machine needs to at least have one subassembly",
"createdObject": null
}

DeleteResultIds is used when deleting most of the objects. Returning a list of Ids if the object is in use and cant be deleted: 

{
"success": false,
"error": ""Can't delete machine. Machine placed in order lines.",
"related_ids": [1,2,3]
}

DeleteResultObject is used when deleting an order. We wanted to return deleted order lines instead of just ids. 

{
"Success": true,
"message": "Sample message",
"error": null"
"deletedObjects": [{} // List of order line objects that's been deleted]
}

TopCustomerResponseObject is used when returning an array of x number of customers ordered by highest total order value

{
"id": 2,
"name": "Kelle Walsh",
"totalOrderValue": 30323
},


## Endpoints documentation

All endpoints expect Json Request Body and all endpoints return Json objects.
